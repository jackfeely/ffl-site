# Foundation for Letters Website

The Foundation for Letters (FFL) is a nonprofit organization based in New York City providing urban students and schools with access to innovative writing-intensive academic and enrichment programs that are designed, staffed and funded by volunteers from the literary community and beyond. FFL also helps underserved communities of schools form their own networks of external support that form partnerships, raise funds and engage volunteers who are committed to increasing student engagement with writing.
